# AI-BASED-IDENTIFICATION-OF-UVEITIS-FROM-OCULAR-IMAGING
AI-based identification of uveitis from ocular imaging uses deep learning models to detect inflammation in the eye from retinal images. This approach enables faster, more accurate diagnosis compared to manual methods. It helps ophthalmologists in early detection and treatment planning for patients.
